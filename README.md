# UWB-Indoor-localisation
This research investigates how noise filtering techniques in UWB systems, combined with sensor fusion, can enhance indoor localization accuracy. By integrating data from sensors like Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and applying advanced filtering techniques such as Kalman Filters, the study aims to improve positioning precision.
